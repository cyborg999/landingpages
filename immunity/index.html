              <p>It’s hard to go very far these days without hearing about the benefits of Elderberry. But is it science? Or Science fiction? </p>
              <p>A recent in vitro study published in the Journal of Functional Foods by Torabian showed that Elderberry proved especially effective in late-stage infections. The study confirmed that elderberry exerts its antiviral activity on influenza through a number of mechanisms of action, including suppressing the entry of the virus into the cell, modulating the post-infectious phase, and preventing viral transmission to other cells.</p>

              <b>- KEY INGREDIENT</b>
              <p>You may have heard about the powerful immune system benefits of Garlic. What you haven’t heard though, is that a lot of those benefits are completely lost when you cook the garlic. Allicin is a defense molecule from garlic that, when properly harvested, has been shown to have an amazing impact on combating cold and flu bugs. Studies have shown that Allicin reduces the risk of becoming sick in the first place, as well as how long you stay sick. It can also reduce the severity of symptoms.</p>

              <p>One study gave 146 healthy volunteers either Allicin supplements or a placebo for three months. The Allicin group had a 63% lower risk of getting a cold, and their colds were also 70% shorter if they got the bug.</p>

          <h5>Astragalus</h5>
              <b>- RESERVE BOOST INGREDIENT</b>
              <p>Astragalus has long been used in traditional chinese medicine, with a primary use of boosting the body’s immune system. It is used to treat the common cold, upper respiratory infections, fibromyalgia, and diabetes. Most medical studies evaluating the effects of astragalus on immunity have used cancer models and patients undergoing chemotherapy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that astragalus promotes B-cell proliferation and antibody production and enhances CTL activity.</p>

              <h5>Ginseng</h5>
              <b>- ENDURANCE INGREDIENT </b>
              <p>Ginseng has been used in eastern medicine for centuries to boost the immune system. But it’s not just anecdotal evidence showing that Ginseng is good for you. A study suggested that people who take ginseng could have up to a 35% higher chance of living disease-free for five years after surgeries, and up to a 38% higher survival rate compared to those not taking it.</p>

              <p>Another study showed that ginseng extract could enhance the effect of vaccinations against diseases like influenza.</p>

          <h5>Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc</h5>
          <b class="core">- CORE ESSENTIALS INGREDIENTS</b>
          <p>The common triple-threat for stopping a cold dead in its tracks; these 3 ingredients act as cornerstone pillars for immune defense. </p>
          <p>Vitamin C isn’t naturally produced by iur bodues, but requires it for proper immune function. That’s why it’s so important to supplement it regularly. The most convincing evidence to date comes from a 2013 review of 29 randomized trials with more than 11,000 participants. Researchers found that extremely active people, taking at least 200 mg of vitamin C every day appeared to cut the risk of getting a cold in half.</p>
          <p>Vitamin D can be absorbed via sunlight. But during the cold and flu season, most of us tend to have deficient vitamin D levels. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with frequent infections. In 2009, the National Institute of Health warned that low vitamin D levels are associated with frequent colds and influenza. This shows that we need sun (or vitamin D)!</p>
          <p>Zinc is known to play a central role in the immune system. Those with a zinc deficiency experience increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens. This can lead to infection! It’s clear that zinc has positive effects on multiple aspects of the immune system — from the barrier of the skin to the function of cells mediating nonspecific immunities.</p>
