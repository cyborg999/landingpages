          <h3><em class="red">SYSTEM ALERT!</em> Is Your Gut Under Attack?</h3>
          <p>If you’re getting acid reflux on a daily basis, generally feeling <i>“out of sorts”</i>, and your breath is so stinky you’re running out of mints, then it’s time to point the finger. At your gut. </p>
          <p>Your gut contains TRILLIONS of bacteria and that are both good and bad, but once you have a healthy balance of both you’re A-OK. The problem is that more and more people are experiencing issues with their gut on a daily basis.</p>
          <blockquote>A worldwide study by the American Gastroenterological Association showed that “more than 40% of persons worldwide have FGIDs (functional gastrointestinal disorders), which affect quality of life and health care use”.</blockquote>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig2"></figure>
          <p>This means that the symptoms of poor gut health are affecting millions of people. And these symptoms aren’t going away. </p>
          <div class="sec2_blue">
            <h3>Do You Know What’s Growing In Your Gut??</h3>
            <p>Think of your gut as a garden that needs proper care and nourishment to thrive. If you don’t give it that care and attention, plants will wither and die, weeds will start to grow and take over, and it just won’t be functional anymore.</p>
            <p>If you don’t look after your gut, a similar thing is going to 
            happen and it will become vulnerable to harmful bacteria, 
            h.pylori, viruses, and unwanted pathogens. Resulting 
            in the symptoms commonly associated with an 
            ill-functioning gut, such as:</p>
            <ul class="sec2_ul">
              <li>Gas and bloating</li>
              <li>Constipation and diarrhea</li>
              <li>Bad breath</li>
              <li>Acid reflux & GERD</li>
              <li>Fatigue</li>
              <li>Acne</li>
              <li>IBS</li>
            </ul>
            <figure class="sec2_bg"></figure>
          </div>
          <h3>Why Is This So <em class="red">Important?</em></h3>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig3"></figure>
          <h3><small>1</small>  Let’s Talk About Poop</h3>
          <p>What’s even more concerning, is that many people overlook these symptoms for so long that they simply become the norm. For example do YOU know how much you poop?</p>
          <p>The <b>colon of an average human can hold up to eight meals of poop</b> before it's finally digested.</p>
          <p>That’s already a LOT of poop to be carrying around with you.</p>
          <p>Imagine what your home would smell like if you had 8 bags of that stuff sitting in the kitchen for a week. So if it’s not coming out as regularly as it should be then it’s something you need to sort out. Pronto.</p>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig4"></figure>
          <h3><small>2</small>  Let’s Bust The Myth About Acid Reflux</h3>
          <p>There is a <b>common misconception that acid reflux is primarily caused by excess stomach acid</b>. So, people treat this by depleting their stomach acid even further with acid blocking medication, which A. only serves to band-aid the problem, and B. ultimately makes it worse. Still with me? Good. Because I’m about to explain EXACTLY what’s going on with your gut and how we can get rid of your acid reflux for good.</p>

          <p>It all starts with this little valve called your Lower Esophageal Sphincter Muscle (LES). When you eat, this valve opens to let the food move into your stomach, then <b>once the food has entered your stomach it starts producing acid which triggers your LES to close</b>. All good so far, right? But, what happens when it doesn’t close? Acid reflux happens, that’s what. </p>
          <p><b>When you don’t have enough stomach acid to signal that LES to close properly, the contents of your stomach reflux back up into your esophagus</b> causing symptoms such as heartburn, a chronic cough, and difficulty swallowing. </p>
          <p><b>Another primary cause of GERD is a H.pylori infection</b>, which you can develop due to an overgrowth of small intestinal bacteria in your gut due to low stomach acid. HCI is crucial in the maintenance of a sterile stomach environment and it creates this by protecting against unwanted pathogens and providing a barrier against bacterial overgrowth. So when you have low stomach acid, you’re much more vulnerable to this problem.</p>
          <p>As a result, <b>studies have shown a link between H. pylori and GERD. When you have GERD</b>, the food gets fermented in your gut instead of being digested and, amongst other symptoms, this does not make your gas smell pretty. If you’re suffering from acid reflux more than 3 times a week then it’s a good indication that this has progressed into GERD.</p>
          <blockquote>“Based on our findings, significant evidence suggests the potential role of HP infection in the development of GERD. Also, the current data provides sufficient evidence to define the relationship between GERD and HP infection.”</blockquote>
          <i>- Fatin R. Polat, MD and Sabriye Polat, JSLS</i>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig5"></figure>
          <h3><small>3</small> The Inflammatory Response</h3>
          <p><b>Chronic acid reflux and GERD leads to inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus</b> that can be extremely painful and often lead to the burning sensation of heartburn. Think of it like burning your hand on the oven, if you don’t cover it up with anything then you’ll get that familiar “ow!” feeling every time you brushed it against something. </p>
          <p>The problem with having these acid burns in your esophagus is that you can’t just bandage them up until they heal, and nor can you leave them to heal on their own when your acid reflux is ongoing as they will just continue to worsen, you have to take another approach.</p>
          <p>By <b>coating the lining of your stomach and esophagus with the right supplements</b> on a customized treatment plan that also gets to the root of your acid reflux, you can give your gut the time to <b>heal this inflammation and cure your acid reflux</b> for good.</p>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig6"></figure>
          <h3><small>4</small> Why You're Feeling Rundown</h3>
          <p>HCI also contributes to the absorption of the foods you eat. If you’re waking up exhausted and feel like you're picking up every cold or flu that’s floating around then it’s a clear sign that your gut is struggling. If you’re <b>not digesting your food properly, your body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs</b> to perform at its best. Without a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria growing in your gut, it also isn’t equipped with the army it needs to fight back against unwelcome viruses and pathogens.</p>
          <figure class="sec2l_fig7"></figure>
          <h3><small>5</small> Where Did That Ulcer Come From?</h3>
          <p>When <b>acid reflux is left untreated it will gradually wear away at the lining of your stomach and esophagus</b> which leads to the development of painful ulcers. What's most important in this instance is to allow your gut to heal whilst also treating the root cause of your acid reflux, and our supplements are developed to do just that.</p>
          <h3>What Causes This <em class="red">GUT SOS?</em></h3>
          <p>To summarize, your gut isn’t performing properly because</p>
          <ul class="sec2_ul">
            <li>Your digestion is poor</li>
            <li>Your stomach acid is too low</li>
            <li>PPIs and Acid Blockers could be making it worse</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>So How Do We Fix It?</h3>
          <p>Our <b>Heartburn Relief</b> contains a carefully formulated solution with a specific blend of ingredients developed to <b>increase your stomach acid levels and soothe and treat your symptoms</b>. As our Reflux Inhibitor gets to work on resolving your acid reflux for good, our Acid Relief will get rid of those painful heartburn and indigestion symptoms you’re experiencing. </p>
          <div class="sec2_testi">
            <figure class="sec2l_fig8"></figure>
            <blockquote>“According to Jonathan Wright, MD, “In 24 years of 
              nutritionally oriented practice, I’ve worked with thousands 
              of individuals who’ve found the cause of their heartburn 
              and indigestion to be low stomach acidity. In nearly all of 
              these folks, symptoms have been relieved and digestion 
              improved when they’ve taken supplemental hydrochloric 
              acid and pepsin capsules. (Certainly it would be preferable 
              that our stomach production of hydrochloric acid and 
              pepsin be restored on its own, but a reliable way to do this 
              hasn’t been found.)”</blockquote>

I checked into it, ordered the kit the acid inhibitor & acid relief first. Had a little coaching as well but was getting relief am taking it before my biggest meal "breakfast." As I think that's most important. Works best if off all PPI's but did gradually then today been 3rd day completely off Pantoprazole generic Protonix 40 mg twice daily 30 min b4  breakfast & supper. Famotidine 20mg generic pepsin @ bedtime ( way too much!) as the supplements won't work effectively. The last 2 yrs have been awful!. Could not hardly eat anything. So supplements are working very well along with PH  Balancer, advanced probiotic & detox cleanse as I have colon issues. I'm seeing a HUGE  difference! Can't thank Terra Health Essentials Enough for coaching me along. Also ordered Digestive Aid, to help with my IBS because my digestive system was all out of whack. Thanks again Terra Health Essentials!” <em>- Teresa Douthitt</em></p>
