                            <p>These cameras are very small and work great. They are very accurate and the weather doesn’t seem to affect the way they work at all. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.</p>

                            <p>The reviews stated it was easy to set up and I had to agree. I had them up and running in no time and was amazed at the clarity and settings for each camera. I purchased these to observe our second home from 600 miles away and they picked up WiFi on the property for quite some distance.</p>

                            <p>Fantastic! Should have bought the 5-pack. I liked it so much I ordered 2 more. Crystal clear video playback on iPhone and the app works great with it. Easy to set up. Detects the slightest movement of an object. The live view has fantastic quality. 300 miles away & I could still communicate very well with guests!</p>

                            <p>We purchased this system this winter to keep an eye on our vacation home in Florida. The system is very easy to set up. The instructions are intuitive. The build quality is nice, and the best part is that there's no batery! We are so glad that we chose this system over the more complicated wired systems.</p>

                            <p>I bought the system just to monitor what was going on around my house. We had someone break into a small storage building. The wireless feature allowed me to place a camera inside the building and with the great night vision we captured a great video of the thief. He did end up seeing the small blue light on the camera and looked directly at it and ran. From a screen shot of the video the police identified and arrested the guy.</p>

                            <p>A family member has the Nomad Security® and recommended it to us. We installed these to the front and back of our home. We love that they are discreet enough to be hardly noticeable and easy to adjust. The sensitivity can also be adjusted so the camera only alerts you when people are visible. We highly recommend it!</p>
