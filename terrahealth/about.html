                        <em>Q: Why are garlic and psyllium husk for added to the detox blend for a decrease in bloating?</em>
                        <p>A: Although garlic is a high FODMAP food, it’s historically well known for its cleansing properties and stimulates the liver to produce enzymes to flush out toxins. The reduction in bloating from the detox cleanse is primarily due to its colon cleansing action. Early research also suggests that taking garlic twice daily for 6 months improves digestion, stops the growth of H.pylori, and reduces stomach inflammation.</p>
