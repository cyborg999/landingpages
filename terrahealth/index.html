                <h2>The Shocking Dangers of Acid Blockers</h2>
                <p>The primary purpose of most heartburn remedies is to block stomach acid in the digestive tract, often by inhibiting it from producing this acid. But stomach acid is essential for the proper absorption of vital nutrients to maintain overall health and consistent comfort.</p>
                <p>Stomach acid is absolutely vital for our digestive health. It helps us break down and absorb the foods we eat. Without adequate acid levels, foods aren’t digested properly, which creates the gas and bloating that can cause acid to reflux up into the esophagus.</p>
