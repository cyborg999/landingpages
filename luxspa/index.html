					<p>Before installing this filtered shower head, I had a lot of issues with mineral build-up on my scalp causing intense itching. This filter solved that problem. I hope it can also help keep the glass shower doors cleaner.</p>

					<p>I love it! The well water in my new house is hard and I didn’t have an expensive water softener, so my skin dried out terribly. LuxSpa was a fast and easy solution. My skin softened back up after just a week.</p>

					<p>We've had the shower heads for a year now and it has helped our hair and skin tremendously! My hair is healthy and shiny. My skin is soft and smooth. We stocked up on a bunch of the filter refills, as I know we will be using this forever. This is a wonderful shower head!</p>
